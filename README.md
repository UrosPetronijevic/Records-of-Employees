Project Description: Records of Employees

The "Records of Employees" application is a comprehensive employee management system designed to track and manage employee working hours, absences, and corresponding payments. It provides an intuitive interface for recording and categorizing non-working days, such as vacations, sick leaves, holidays, and other absences. These categories are treated differently based on company policies and are calculated accordingly for accurate payroll processing.

This application simplifies employee record-keeping, enhances transparency, and streamlines payroll management by providing clear insights into attendance and payment structures.
